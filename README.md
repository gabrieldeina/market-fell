<h1>Market Fell</h1>

<p>Market Fell is a website made with NESTJS and Angular frameworks.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>In each folder here you can access the README.md made by the frameworks that explain how you will install them. Before running the backend, you must read the topic below, Usage.</p>
<b><sub>Access the <i>backend</i> and <i>frontend</i> folders so you can follow the instructions and execute the API and the frontend.</sub></b>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Inside the <i>backend</i> folder you will have access to the <i>.env.example'</i> file that should be copied, pasted at the same level of directory and renamed to <i>.env</i>.</p>
<p>After that, you will need to create a new schema on your database, the name of the schema must be placed on DB_NAME line, inside the <i>.env</i>.</p>

<p>The program was developed using MySQL. If you want to use another database, feel free to do it - but you will have to configurate the enviroment.</p>

<p><b>After this, inside the <i>.env</i> file you will need to especify your database path.</b></p>
<sub>Here is an example</sub>
<code>// SQL command
CREATE SCHEMA `marketfell`;

// .env file

# DB

DB_HOST='localhost'
DB_USERNAME='root'
DB_PASSWORD='yourPasswordHere'
DB_NAME='marketfell'
</code>
